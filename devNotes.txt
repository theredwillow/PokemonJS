CAMPAIGN IDEAS
- After defeating the main world, you are able to visit the airport.
    The airport consists of:
        1. A ticket booth you can use to visit prebuilt worlds... wherever the location builder set the portals to, laid out
        2. A volunteer trip travel center. An employee helps you build your volunteer trip by combining campaigns... you can subscribe to an author to see them first or block an author to hide them. There is also a random picker.
- Campaign builder
- Language settings, only enter English speaking campaigns
- Campaign deletion handling: holding room in airport with vague newspapers on the table "<Name of location> disappears! Survivors confused but brought to the <user's home> airport", leaving the room locks the door
- Create gym leaders based on strengthes and weaknesses, types and levels

SENSAIS

- Beginning of the game, you choose one when you choose your starter
- Three have different end results
- Rare random fights against pokemon stronger than you are handled by sensai
- You're required to talk to all lab techs before choosing a sensai, they provide foreshadowing about sensai's
- ONE: vegan, he forces you to catch only one pokemon at a time, it follows you like pikachu in yellow, your pokemon happiness is always higher than anyone else's, he forces you to quit battles where you'd have to kill a pokemon
    lab tech: "he doesn't let you catch more than one pokemon, I thought that was stupid at first, but my <pokemon> couldn't be happier"
    required campaign: free pokemon from slaughterhouse
- TWO: corrupt dad, he eventually joins Team Rocket and pressures you to too, he helps you catch pokemon randomly, he encourages you to kill pokemon frequently
    lab tech "you grew up around him, surely you know he's so unstable. he cost me <time period> in jail and he's always murdering pokemon! but you know what... their is incredible strength in being the first to attact. I've grown a lot more powerful because of him"
- THREE: 
- When your sensai has finished training you, you're free to play user-created campaigns

BADGES:
-vegan advocacy: vegan sensai's required campaign
-team rocket membership: corrupt dad's required
